Exercise 2
Using your client created from exercise 1, connect to a new database, homework6. 
Once you have connected to the database set your collection to a new collection, students.

Exercise 4
What MongoDB type do Python lists get converted to? 
Submit a screen shot of your collection in MongoDB with this python file.

Exercise 5
George Straight accidentally registered for two courses in the SP2 Session. 
Using a pymongo.update(), remove him from Carlin's class

Use the $pull method to extract the element from the array.

Exercise 6
A new student has signed up for all three SP2 sessions, his name is Tom Brady. 
Update the SP2 classes by inserting the student Tom Brady into the students object.

Exercise 8
Using find, print all of the documents to the console. This should be a query against the MongoDB database.

Exercise 9
Instead of using the default hash _id, what would you recommend as a unique ID for each document?

"""
Exercise 10
Drop the students collection from the database AND close your client.
